# reminders - by Oscar Lindqvist (qvistdev09)

## What is this?

A to-do-list creator, on which you can edit to-do-lists with other users in real time. As a user you can create to-do-lists, then add permissions to them to let other users access and edit your lists. Other users can be added as either viewers or editors. You can also change a visibility setting for your list, so that it can be shared as a public list for non-registered users.
